# given situation
- arg is defined in the header, which is a struct
- compare : calling `arg->number_of_philosophers` multiple times vs. int **i = `arg->number_of_philosophers`**

### 1. **Avoiding Repeated Dereferencing**

When you access a member of a structure in C, such as `arg->number_of_philosophers`, the compiler needs to perform a dereference operation to access the value. If you use this member multiple times in a loop or a function, each access involves this dereferencing step. 

For example, in your original code:

```c
while (i <= arg->number_of_philosophers)
```

Every iteration of the loop requires the program to dereference `arg` to access `number_of_philosophers`. If this value is accessed multiple times (like in the `malloc` call and the loop condition), it can lead to unnecessary overhead.

### 2. **Improving Readability**

By introducing a local variable, you make the code clearer and easier to read. Instead of seeing `arg->number_of_philosophers` multiple times, you can use a simple variable name like `number`. This reduces cognitive load for someone reading the code, as they can quickly understand that `number` represents the total number of philosophers.

### 3. **Potential Compiler Optimizations**

While modern compilers are quite good at optimizing code, explicitly storing a value in a local variable can sometimes help the compiler make better optimization decisions. By reducing the number of times it needs to access a structure member, the compiler can optimize the code more effectively.

### 4. **Code Maintenance**

Using a local variable can also make future code maintenance easier. If you ever need to change how you calculate or retrieve the number of philosophers, you only need to update it in one place (where you set the `number` variable) rather than in multiple locations throughout your code.

### Example Comparison

**Original Code:**
```c
philos = malloc(arg->number_of_philosophers * sizeof(t_philo));
while (i <= arg->number_of_philosophers)
{
    // ...
}
```

**Updated Code:**
```c
int number = arg->number_of_philosophers;
philos = malloc(number * sizeof(t_philo));
while (i <= number)
{
    // ...
}
```

### Summary

In summary, creating a local variable to store `arg->number_of_philosophers`:
- Reduces the number of dereference operations, improving performance.
- Enhances code readability and maintainability.
- Allows for potential compiler optimizations.

This practice is a common coding technique in C and other programming languages to write cleaner and more efficient code.
