In C, the `sigset_t` type represents a set of signals. When you use the `sigemptyset()` function, it initializes the `sigset_t` variable to an empty signal set, meaning it contains no signals. 

### Definition of `sigset_t`

The exact implementation of `sigset_t` may vary depending on the platform and compiler, but it is typically defined in a system header file, such as `<signal.h>`. The `sigset_t` type is usually implemented as an integer type or a struct that holds a bitmask representing the signals.

### Example of `sigset_t` Structure

While the exact definition is not usually exposed directly in the headers (as it's platform-specific), you can think of it as something similar to this:

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned long sig[128 / (8 * sizeof(unsigned long))]; // Example size for 128 signals
} sigset_t;
```

### How `sigemptyset()` Works

When you call `sigemptyset(&set);`, it sets all bits in the `sigset_t` variable `set` to 0, effectively indicating that no signals are included in this set. 

### Visual Representation

You can visualize the signal set as an array of bits, where each bit represents whether a specific signal is included:

- **Empty set**: 
```
0000000000000000  (All bits are 0)
```
- **Set containing SIGINT**: (assuming SIGINT corresponds to the first bit)
```
0000000000000001  (Only the first bit is 1)
```

### Usage with `sigaddset()`

You would typically follow `sigemptyset()` with `sigaddset()` to add specific signals to your signal set:

```c
sigset_t my_set;
sigemptyset(&my_set); // Initialize to empty set
sigaddset(&my_set, SIGINT); // Add SIGINT to the set
```

In this example, after the calls, `my_set` would contain a signal set with only the `SIGINT` signal.

### Conclusion

The `sigset_t` type is an abstract representation used to manage signals in a program. Its actual representation is hidden from the user, allowing you to manipulate signal sets using functions like `sigemptyset()` and `sigaddset()` without worrying about the underlying implementation.
