Hereâ€™s an example of how the subject file (e.g., `subject.md`) might look for practicing writing this code:

# Silent Auction Program

### **Objectives**

Create a Python program that:
1. Accepts bids from multiple participants.
2. Determines the highest bidder and announces the winner.
3. Implements a clean way to manage multiple bidders, including clearing the console for privacy.

---

### **Instructions**

1. **Program Flow**:
   - Display a welcome logo at the start of the program.
   - Prompt the user to enter their name and bid amount.
   - Store each participant's name and bid in a dictionary.
   - Ask if there are additional bidders:
     - If "yes," clear the console and continue.
     - If "no," display the highest bidder and terminate the program.

2. **Core Logic**:
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the name and bid of each participant.
   - Use a loop to allow continuous bidding until explicitly stopped.
   - Create a function to find the highest bidder by iterating through the dictionary.

3. **Additional Details**:
   - Ensure bids are input as integers.
   - Make use of a `clear()` function for better console readability during bidding.

---

### **Requirements**

- **Inputs**:
  - User's name: a string.
  - User's bid: a positive integer.

- **Outputs**:
  - The name and bid of the highest bidder at the end of the auction.

- **Features**:
  - Clearing the screen after each bid (use `clear()` from `replit` or implement your own).
  - A well-structured function to determine the winner.

---

### **Hints**

- Use a dictionary to store bids, with names as keys and bid amounts as values.
- To iterate over the dictionary, use `for key in dictionary:` and access values with `dictionary[key]`.
- For clearing the screen, you can use:
  ```python
  import os
  os.system('clear')  # For Mac/Linux
  os.system('cls')    # For Windows
  ```

---

### **Bonus**

- Add input validation to ensure the bid is a valid integer.
- Extend functionality to handle ties or invalid input.
- Use a library like `art` to display a fun auction logo at the start.

### **Example Output**

```plaintext
 ____  _               _     _              _             
/ ___|| |__   ___  ___| | __(_)  ___ ___   | |_ ___  _ __ 
\___ \| '_ \ / _ \/ __| |/ /| | / __/ _ \  | __/ _ \| '__|
 ___) | | | |  __/ (__|   < | || (_|  __/  | || (_) | |   
|____/|_| |_|\___|\___|_|\_\|_| \___\___|   \__\___/|_|   
                                                        
What is your name?: Alice
What is your bid?: $150
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes or 'no'.
> yes

[Screen clears]

What is your name?: Bob
What is your bid?: $200
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes or 'no'.
> no

The winner is Bob with a bid of $200.
```

### **Files to Create**

- `silent_auction.py`: The Python program file for the auction logic.
- `subject.md`: This instruction file for practicing writing the code from scratch.

--- 

### **Goals**

- Practice creating a basic CLI application in Python.
- Familiarize yourself with dictionaries, loops, and functions.
- Gain experience working with input, output, and program structure.
