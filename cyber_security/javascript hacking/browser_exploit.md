# intro

- it's scary
- why? simply visiting can compromise your machine by installing malware.

# browser sandbox
- implement a browser
- attacker can put an arbitrary code 

# architecture of the browser
- changes over years
## parent process
- most browsers now have a privileged parent process which is like *a regular processs that can do anything

- <=> actual website rendering(tab,...): another process to restrict *that proc

- websites with HTML, JS

- how these restrictions are implemented : depends on OS

- for example, Linux uses 'seccomp'

- -> we can restrict the render, when handling potentially malicious content

## but the restriction is not easy

### IPC: inter process communication
-wwe implement this protocol

### sandbox implementation idea
- you have "low-privileged render/content processes"
- and "they" use IPC to communicate with the parent, if they wanna do anything requires higher privileges, and let the parent deal with it
- -> related to exploitation

	if u find a vulnerability in HTML/JS, you can take over this process, but very restricted

	Now you need to find a sec. vulnerabillity in the sandbox implementation
