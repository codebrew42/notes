# SHA-256 : secure hash algorithm 256-bit

## 0.basic
### hash
- digital fingerprint for data
- takes info(files, pw, ...) and turns it into fixed-size str
- the str represent the original data, but is unique to it
- <=> if two different files contain the exact same string (like "hello"), they produce the same SHA-256 hash.

## 1.def
- cryptographic hash func 
- produces fixed-size, 256-bit(32-byte) has val from an input

## 2.characteristics

### deterministic
- same input -> same hash output
### fixed size
- regardless of the input size -> output 256 bits
### fast to compute
- be calculated quickly for any input
### premage resistance
- given a hash, should be infeasible to find the original input
### collision resistance
- two diff inputs cannot produce the same hash
### avalanche effect
- small change (even a single bit) of the input will produce diff hash

### typically 64-char hex str
- Input: "Hello, World!"
- SHA-256 Hash: "a591a6d40bf420404a011733cfb7b190d62c65bf0bcda190b7c1c9d1f6cbb8b5"
-> the str will always produce the same SHA-256 hash


## 3.uses
### data intergrity
- verify that data hasn't been altered
### digital signatures
- in various crpytographic protocols
### pw hashing
- store pw securely in databases
### blockchain
- secure transactions&blocks
