Can you figure out what is in the eax register? 
Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} 
where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.

<+0>:     endbr64 
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rsi
<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
<+25>:    pop    rbp
<+26>:    ret

[notes]
<+0> includes
<+4> base pointer will be the same as the stack pointer
<+5> copy stack pointer to base pointer
<+8> move the first argument to the eax register
<+22> move the value of the eax register to the eax register
<+25> pop the base pointer

<+26> return


0x9fe1a = decimal 652186
since Dword can hold 4 bytes, the value is 652186
1 hexadecimal digit = 4 bits
5 hexadecimal digits = 20 bits = 4 bytes

picoCTF{652186}
