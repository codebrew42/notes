# X.509 Certificates in OpenSSL

The x509 command in OpenSSL is used to manage X.509 certificates, which are a standard format for public key certificates. These certificates are widely used in various security protocols, including SSL/TLS, to establish secure communications over networks.

## Common Uses of the x509 Command

1. **Display Certificate Information**: You can use `openssl x509` to view the details of a certificate, such as its issuer, subject, validity period, and public key.

2. **Convert Certificate Formats**: The command can convert certificates between different formats, such as PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules).

3. **Create Self-Signed Certificates**: The x509 command can also be used to create self-signed certificates, which are useful for testing or internal use.

4. **Verify Certificates**: It can verify the validity of a certificate against a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate.

Overall, the x509 command is a crucial part of managing and working with digital certificates in OpenSSL.
