## from 64

In computer programming, Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that transforms binary data into a sequence of printable characters, limited to a set of 64 unique characters.

### example

cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDdiOTFjNzl9

- decoded string : picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_07b91c79}

### Base64 Encoding: 
- Base64 is a way to encode binary data (like text) into ASCII characters. It's often used to encode data for safe transmission over text-based formats, like email or URLs. The encoded string you provided is in Base64 format.

- binary text : the letter A in ASCII is represented by the binary sequence 01000001.

### Decoding Base64
- When decoding, we reverse this process by converting the Base64 back to the original text or binary data.
