# Learning from others' code

- Using others' code from GitHub, analyzing it, and then starting your own project is a valid approach to learning and development. However, the effectiveness of this method depends on how you apply it. 

## **Pros**
1. **Efficient Learning**:
   - Reviewing well-written code allows you to quickly learn practical patterns and best practices.
   - You gain insights into how experienced developers solve problems.

2. **Saves Time**:
   - Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can fast-track your development by starting with proven solutions.

3. **Idea Expansion**:
   - Observing others’ code can inspire new ideas or highlight aspects you may have overlooked.

## **Cons**
1. **Reduced Creativity**:
   - Relying too heavily on others’ solutions might limit your ability to think independently and solve problems creatively.

2. **Shallow Understanding**:
   - If you focus more on using the code rather than understanding it, you may miss the deeper concepts and mechanics.

3. **Risk of Using Poor Code**:
   - Not all public code is well-written or efficient. Adopting flawed code can introduce issues into your project.

## **Alternatives or Complementary Approaches**

### 1. **Try Solving It Yourself First**
   - Attempt to write your own solution from scratch before looking at others' work. Even partial solutions help you engage with the problem.

### 2. **Set Specific Goals When Referencing Code**
   - Clearly define what you want to learn from the code. For example, focus on how APIs are implemented or how certain algorithms are structured.

### 3. **Rewrite and Adapt**
   - Don’t just copy and paste. Rewrite the referenced code in your own style or tweak it to fit your needs. This reinforces learning.

### 4. **Use Official Documentation and Best Practices**
   - Instead of looking at code examples, refer to official documentation or best practice guides to understand the core principles.

### 5. **Recommended "No Reference" Methods**
   - **Break Down the Problem**: Divide the problem into smaller pieces and solve them one by one.
   - **Write Pseudo-Code**: Draft the algorithm or logic in natural language before converting it into actual code.
   - **Practice Coding Challenges**: Use platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank to build problem-solving skills without relying on others' code.

### **Conclusion**
- If your primary goal is **short-term learning**, analyzing others' code is a great way to build knowledge and skills.  
- However, for **long-term improvement**, focus on developing your own problem-solving abilities. A balanced approach—trying first on your own and then referencing others for refinement—is ideal.
